The image is supposed to show the divided nature of the two most prominent organizations in American politics. The idea was to divide the word “AMERICA” vertically at the R, with a party on both sides represented by their party’s color and images of commonly supported policies and ideologies. It turns out scaling images down and finding images that aren’t a major hassle to cut out from their background is a huge pain. I was originally going to create the entire word “AMERICA” with images only, but I think I might just only do 1 or 2 for both, or add a single image to a preexisting letter somehow. I’m also unsatisfied with the divide between democrat and republican (white line in “R” and shifting from red to blue).
After hastily putting together the image I also realized I put the republicans on the left in the word and the democrats on the right in the word. It’s a completely missed opportunity to put the democrats on the left and the republicans on the right in the word “AMERICA”. In fact, having the republicans on the left and democrats on the right is more than just a missed opportunity, it’s downright distracting. 
In contrast to a detailed image of the word “AMERICA”, I could instead use an outline of
the USA to convey the ideologies commonly supported by each group. A simple bicolored “AMERICA” centered in the USA outline and on top of a collage of news article headlines (colored in red or blue) within the outline of the USA. In this way I can show a divided America, working with layers, and would hopefully avoid the hassle of scaling and whitespace that I would need to handle if I worked instead with a highly detailed bipartisan image of the word “AMERICA”.
